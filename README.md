My school is High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technology (HSTAT)

During the summer, I was able to participate in a program called StartUp Tech Summer run by the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship. Twenty four people were accepted into this program. We were told to make teams of five except my team consisted of four people. We created an app and business called Community Connected, CC'ed for short. The app was created to make tracking community service hours easier for schools and students. My position on the team was lead engineer and my job was to build the app including its features and have it finished enough to demo for the judges. Eight weeks of hard work and spending many hours with our mentors from Capital One Bank really paid off. At the end of the program all of the teams compete against each other to win $5000. We had to create a pitch deck and present in front of over two hundred people. My team and I felt as if we had no chance of winning but when they announced the winners we were overjoyed to find out that it was us. Overall, this experience has change me for the better, taught me a lot about myself, taught me a lot about life, how to run my own business, what it takes to run my own business, and better and more efficient ways to code.
